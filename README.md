## 🤔 Philosophy Behind the Code

This blog isn’t just code — it’s a nod to the thinkers who lived between lines.  
Binary & Being combines existential questions with digital creation:

- Why do we build?  
- What does it mean to publish in the void?  
- How does code become memory?  

You’ll feel these questions echoed in every corner of the layout.
