It tells the story of an engineer named <strong>Jan Dolski</strong>, stranded alone on a harsh planet, who must create alternate versions of himself — each with different pasts and personalities — to survive.</p><p>The idea was developed by the Polish studio <strong>11 bit studios</strong>, known for masterpieces like <em>This War of Mine</em> and <em>Frostpunk</em>. Released on June 13, 2025, for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, the game combines survival, base-building, and psychological storytelling.</p><h3>The Story Behind the Game</h3><p>Jan Dolski is the sole survivor of a failed space mission. On a hostile planet with a deadly sun, he builds a rotating base to escape the harsh light. But to maintain and develop the base, he must create <em>Alters</em> — clones representing different possible life paths he could have taken, each with unique skills and personalities.</p><h3>Gameplay and Mechanics</h3><p>The Alters features resource management, base-building, and time-sensitive survival mechanics where every decision matters. You must balance the needs and conflicts of your Alters while racing against time and the planet's dangers.</p><h3>Meet the Creative Minds</h3><p>The game’s narrative was crafted by <strong>Magda Gamrot</strong> (Lead Writer), <strong>Katarzyna Tybinka</strong> (Senior Writer), and <strong>Tomasz Kisilewicz</strong> (Game Director). Their goal was to create a human experience about choices, identity, and the lives we might have lived.</p><p>Voice actor <strong>Alex Jordan</strong> brought life to all Alters, recording over 400 hours of dialogue to give each clone a unique personality.</p><h3>Why The Alters Matters</h3><p>The Alters is more than a survival game — it’s a philosophical exploration of self and possibility. It challenges players to reflect on their own decisions and alternate selves, wrapped in a thrilling sci-fi adventure.</p><p>Are you ready to face the many versions of yourself?</p>5:["id","6","d"]
